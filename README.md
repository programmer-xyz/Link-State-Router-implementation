# Link-State-Router-implementation
The Internet is composed of many independent networks (called autonomous systems) that must cooperate in order for packets to reach their destinations. This necessitates different protocols and algorithms for routing packets within autonomous systems, where all routers are operated by the same entity, and between autonomous systems, where business agreements and other policy considerations affect routing decisions. This assignment focuses on intra-domain routing algorithms used by routers within a single autonomous system (AS). The goal of intra-domain routing is typically to forward packets along the shortest or lowest cost path through the network. The need to rapidly handle unexpected router or link failures, changing link costs (usually depending on traffic volume), and connections from new routers and clients, motivates the use of distributed algorithms for intra-domain routing. In these distributed algorithms, routers start with only their local state and must communicate with each other to learn the lowest-cost paths.
